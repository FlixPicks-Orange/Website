      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 20px; font-size: 20px;">FlixPicks - an aggregation service that shows the user what's showing on multiple streaming services, and helps the user choose media to watch.</p>
      <h1>Solution Characteristics</h1>
      <ul style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 20px; font-size: 20px;">
        <li>A application where users can view all of their subscriptions in one place.</li>
        <li>On this application, the user will be recommended relevant media based on their interests and will get recommendations from each of their subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Users will also be able to like and make comments on specific sections of the media they are viewing. This allows for users to easily find the most liked parts of media they are watching, and to see what other users have shared about the media as they watch. </li>
      </ul>
        <h1>Solution Features</h1>
        <ul style="text-align: left; padding: 0px 20px; font-size: 20px;">
            <li><strong>CineRoll</strong> randomly selects a movie for the user from their recommended media. If indecision is an issue, this feature is great for helping the user find something catered to their taste quickly. This feature can be filtered based on genre and media type (TV shows, movies, etc).</li>
            <li><strong>CineWheel</strong> randomly selects between a selection of user inputted media, it allows a user to enter all the media to be randomly selected from.</li>
            <li><strong>CineMap</strong> is an overlay that runs over the media a user is watching (if they choose to use it), that allows them to interact, make comments, and view interactions and comments. Using the link provided by FlixPicks the user is directed to their content of choice. It allows users to see a timeline throughout the media of where other users have interacted the most with it, as well as allowing users to interact and make comments themself. </li>
