          <p>Hello everyone, I am Chance Sadler and I am an online student from Virginia. I expect to gain more experience before joining the software engineering workforce. I hope to finish a project that I expect to be the largest I've been apart of so far. I haven't had any job experience in the computer science field. Depending on work load for the semester I may apply for a part time job or internship. Previous employment has been in the food service industry and a summer camp position. The experience I've gained from them has been more oriented to communication and improvisation.</p>
